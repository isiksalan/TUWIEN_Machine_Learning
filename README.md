# TUWIEN_Machine_Learning
Machine Learning codes for 184.702 Machine Learning (VU 3,0) 2021W in TU WIEN



In the Folder "Classification" you will find 4 different (by size,dimensionsions,number of classes etc. )dataset classifications
with their necessary pre-processing steps.
Importing the data, data explorations and preprocessing (missing values, outliers, scaling, encoding, etc.), classification process,
evaluating and analysing the performance and comparing holdout method to cross-validation method can be examined in the presented
codes.

In the Folder "Regression" you will find 3 datasets with diffrented characteristics on which implemented AutoML algorithm from scratch. 
Comparison of this AutoML to  two state of the art AutoML systems (e.g. auto-sklearn, TPOTâ€¦) can be found in the codes as well.

In each of the folders there is a report file that you can examine for details regarding the implementations.
